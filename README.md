# MKE-apartments

This project maps, catalogues, and attempts to typologize historic prewar and interwar apartment buildings, built before 1939 and at least as early as 1883, within Milwaukee's city limits: Eastside and downtown, Westtown, Northwest Side, Old North Milwaukee, Walker's Point/5th Ward, West Milwaukee, and Bay View. It includes the discrete village of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay and cities of St. Francis, Cudahy, and South Milwaukee. This project excludes (for now) the inner ring suburbs Wauwatosa, West Allis, Greenfield, or Greendale, because they developed as discrete entities within Milwaukee County. The following ZIP codes are represented (with a building count):  53110 (15), 53172 (4), 53202 (245), 53203 (20), 53204 (25), 53205 (37), 53206 (63), 53207 (45), 53208 (124), 53209 (48), 53210 (34), 53211 (187), 53212 (78), 53213 (4), 53214 (2), 53215 (25), 53216 (23), 53217 (6), 53218 (1), 53233 (203), and 53235 (1).
Additional layers coming soon for rowhomes - tenements and adjoined/stacked flats - and apartment hotels, but only those which were/are primarily hotels that offer apartment suites. This project will continue to exclude boarding houses, lodging houses, and rooming houses.
Comments, questions & feedback encouraged & appreciated! Please contact me if you've found an unmapped building or can provide any details!
